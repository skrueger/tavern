# Tavern

## About
Tavern is a kernel for the [Raspberry Pi Model 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/).

It is Simon Krueger's hobby-project and its main goal is education.
The project grew out of [Stanford's 2018 CS140e course](https://cs140e.sergio.bz/).
You will benefit from this project if you're interested
in learning about code for kernels, rust, or raspberry pi 3 hardware.

## Development

Tavern is developed with

- liunx
- Rust (v1.74.0-nightly aarch64-unknown-none)
- Make
- aarch64 toolchain
- qemu aarch64

## Raspberry Pi Model 3B+

The Raspberry Pi Model 3B+ runs a Broadcom BCM2837 SoC.
